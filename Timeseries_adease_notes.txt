Google intellicence(ads) like adease

in Incognito -- everything is still tracked but cant use it to train(wont be tied to your identity)
Ip-add, browser,Mac-add

Cookie(insta will attach this cookie when you click on one of their posts and then they track your movements across websites and gives ads based on it)

For websites that I have never visited before -- highest Throughtput(highest response/secs) ads




So there a contact between a website and intellisence

1- A website(NyTimes.com) has multiple ad slots 
2- inside each slot, there is a func (given to this website by intellisence)
3- argument of func is cookie that google has attached to you
3- output of func is scaler ads
4- each of these functions are like contracts

5- now NYTimes can have contract with multiple companies(adease, intellisence,etc)-- whichever contract paying highest -- those ads shown to you

6- cost model for these adease companies

(CPC -- Cost per click -- if scalar ad clicked by 1 user-- scaler will pay $1(0.2 cents to adease and 0.8 cents to Nytimes, Scalar doesn't pay anything(some costs to NYtimes) to Adease if no clicks.. so they have to train their model in such a way)
(CPT-- Cost per milli -- you pay $1 if you show the ad to 1000 people-that may/maynot have clicked the ad
CPT works when company cares of advertising like apple titanium -- dont care if people buy)


Adease costs will be -- payment to NYTimes.com for showing ads in their platform
